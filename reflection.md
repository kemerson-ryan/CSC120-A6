- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I enjoy using inheritance, I enjoy it. I think since I did not write the Building class myself, I would not remember to take advantage of all of the functionality of the class. 
I had fun figuring it out wiht the readMe provided, but went in circles with my dad's help, as he was saying to organize the code a different way to make it be more user-friendly, which I tried to see if he was right, but found out it didn't work with the restock method requirement. I know the cafe code quite well now. Based on how you (Jordan) were talking about the assignment when you assigned it, I think that I have just way too much code but I'm not sure how I could shorten the Cafe class while still having it be user-friendly and make sense.

I wish we had like an answer key example to show us (after submission) how we could have approached the assignment to optimize our code.
